- The solution utilizes a pretrained resnet to generate embeddings. As an alternative, a pretrained model more specialized in image similarity queries could be used. For example, something like a siamese CNN.
- I made some assumptions about the overall sizes of anomalies in the image to produce estimate for the window size. Here something more sophiscated than sliding window could be use to obtain image patches.
- The solution utilizes a simple thresholding to detect anomalies from the cosine similarity matrix of embeddings. Here, a more sophiscated anomaly detection algoritm could be applied such as one-class-svm.
- The same pretrained model could be applied to some other surface, here the only problem is that the threshold needs to be readjusted for every new surface.
